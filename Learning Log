## July 31, 2025
- Built my first HTML site (title, header, paragraph, button)
- Learned how `<link>` connects to CSS
- Added button that changes background color using JavaScript
- Understood skeleton of all websites

✅ What worked: CSS styling is fun!
❌ Challenge: JS syntax is confusing — I need to understand and understand the language
🔁 Next: Learn about event listeners and functions with parameters
